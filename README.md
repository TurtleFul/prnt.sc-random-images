# prnt.sc-random-images

prnt.sc is all online. kind of weird. A major security risk to say the least.
Don't host or upload any images there unless you want them to come up when you run this script.

Opens a random image from prnt.sc, be ware... some weird stuff might come up.

use at your own risk.
